			Andrea joined the lab in Fall 2020 and is loving the variety of working here, from molecular lab techniques to data management to macro photography and teaching and supporting others. She continues her work in Idaho supporting the lab of Dr <a href="https://thehamiltonlab.github.io/hamilton-lab/"  target="_blank" rel="noopener">Chris Hamilton</a>.
			</p>
			<p class="text-faded">
			She received her MS in Natural Resources from the University of Idaho, and a BA in Environmental Biology and Fine Arts from University of Colorado. She managed the daily work in a limnology (freshwater ecology) lab in Colorado, and brings experience from work in analytical chemistry, tree physiology, soils, fish ecology, and forestry. She is now thoroughly enjoying exploring arthropods and DNA.

			Alex joined the lab in 2019 and excels in many bioinformatics skills including tool development, data management, database design, computer vision and machine learning.
			</p>
			<p class="text-faded">
			His research involves combining deep learning with citizen science databases to design machine
			learning models capable of identifying thousands of North American arthropods genera from photographs. He hopes his work can be used by the public and academia and be a first step towards changing how arthropod identification is done.

			Originally from Idaho, Alex received his BS in Medical Sciences from University of Idaho and is currently working on MS in Bioinformatics and Computational Biology. He is now pursuing a PhD in cancer genomics at the University of Minnesota.

            Heide joined the lab in spring 2023, through an Agricultural Biology Undergraduate Research Fellowship.  She is majoring in agricultural biology with a concentration in entomology.
            </p>
            <p class="text-faded">
            Heide was born and raised in northern California, and received her associate degree from the Santa Rosa Junior College, where she majored in botany.  She spent many years leading wildflower hikes at the Pepperwood Preserve in Sonoma County, where she was also certified as a naturalist by the University of California in 2019.  In 2021 her husband's company asked them to relocate to Colorado and she agreed, on the stipulation that she could go back to school. Since arriving in Colorado, she has volunteered for the Butterfly Pavilion, the Colorado Butterfly Monitoring Network, and the Colorado Pika Project.  When Heide is not looking for flora and fauna in her yard, she enjoys hiking, gardening, baking, arts and crafts, (including making Halloween costumes for her daughter), and spending time with her husband, daughter, and their dog.

            Mickey is a senior at Colorado State University, originally from Westchester County, New York, majoring in natural resources management with a minor in entomology. His academic focus revolves around ecosystem sustainability, conservation, and education, with a specific interest in the preservation of pollinators. Recently, Mickey has been involved in the classification and identification of Lepidopteran species at the CP Gillette Museum. Additionally, he has contributed to bumble bee research with the Forest and Rangeland Stewardship Department, supporting graduate students in their work. During his free time, he actively participates in citizen science projects and pursues passion for outdoor activities such as backpacking, climbing, birding, photography, and more. During the summer of 2022, Mickey began  volunteer work at the Museum, focusing on handling groups of moths and bees. He has contributed to the data basing efforts for both the Montana Moth Project and the iDigBees project through the SCAN Portal. Building on this experience, he extended his involvement by participating in a pollinator BioBlitz with the museum in Glacier National Park. Currently, he is engaged in an independent study, delving into the intricacies of moth diversity and abundance.
