			Marek is a biologist interested in biodiversity, including its cataloging and description (taxonomy), and processes that created it (speciation, phylogeny).
			</p>
			<p class="text-muted">
			In his work he combines field work, systematics, molecular phylogenetics, and computing. He enjoys developing bioinformatic tools and using machine learning to solve difficult problems. When not at the computer or in the lab, you can find him outside searching for ants, hiking, running, or skiing.
			</p>
			<p class="text-muted">
			Currently Marek is an Assistant Professor at Colorado State University and Director of C. P. Gillette Museum of Arthropod Diversity, based in the Department of Agricultural Biology. He received his PhD from UC Davis in 2016 and he was a postdoc at the Social Insect Research Group at Arizona State University. Prior to joining CSU, he was Assistant Professor at the University of Idaho from 2019 to 2022.

			Zach joined the lab in October 2023.
			</p>
			<p class="text-muted">
			Zach considers himself foremost to be a systematic entomologist, with interest in all information and techniques that support the understanding of insect evolution. His research integrates molecular and morphological data, contextualized by phylogeny, with the aim of delimiting higher taxa that are both consistently diagnosable and reciprocally monophyletic.</p>
			<p class="text-muted">
			He grew up in rural Kentucky, earning a BSc in Entomology at The Ohio State University (2017). This was followed by a PhD at the University of California, Davis under Phil Ward (2023). He spends his spare time writing, reading, and occasionally watching odd or peculiar visual media with his partner and friends.

			A native to Oklahoma, Vilas has lived in a few places across the United States. From obtaining a MS in 2023 in Agricultural Life Sciences from Mississippi State University, a BS in Biological Sciences from the University of California, Santa Barbara, and an AS in Biological Sciences from Moorpark College. Vilas has worked in museum spaces for several years, starting as an undergraduate student and throughout their masters. They love museums and advocate for insects wherever they can. When not working on graduate work, they like to play video games, create art, read, and spending time with their friends.

			Stephanie joined the lab in January of 2021.
			</p>
			<p class="text-muted">
			Her dissertation research focuses on the systematics and ecology of gall wasps and their associated inquilines.

			<p class="text-muted">
			Born and raised in Illinois, she received her MS in Biological Sciences from Eastern Illinois University and a BS in Biology from the University of Illinois at Springfield where she studied the ecology of nectar-producing galls. Stephanie has a passion for the importance of natural history collections and curation of insect specimens. When she is not playing with bugs, she enjoys camping, fishing, cooking/baking, puzzles of all kinds, and spending quality time with her husband and their cats.

			Heide joined the lab in spring 2023, through an Agricultural Biology Undergraduate Research Fellowship.  She is majoring in agricultural biology with a concentration in entomology.
			</p>
			<p class="text-muted">
			Heide was born and raised in northern California, and received her associate degree from the Santa Rosa Junior College, where she majored in botany.  She spent many years leading wildflower hikes at the Pepperwood Preserve in Sonoma County, where she was also certified as a naturalist by the University of California in 2019.  In 2021 her husband's company asked them to relocate to Colorado and she agreed, on the stipulation that she could go back to school. Since arriving in Colorado, she has volunteered for the Butterfly Pavilion, the Colorado Butterfly Monitoring Network, and the Colorado Pika Project.  When Heide is not looking for flora and fauna in her yard, she enjoys hiking, gardening, baking, arts and crafts, (including making Halloween costumes for her daughter), and spending time with her husband, daughter, and their dog.

			Mickey is a senior at Colorado State University, originally from Westchester County, New York, majoring in natural resources management with a minor in entomology. His academic focus revolves around ecosystem sustainability, conservation, and education, with a specific interest in the preservation of pollinators. Recently, Mickey has been involved in the classification and identification of Lepidopteran species at the CP Gillette Museum. Additionally, he has contributed to bumble bee research with the Forest and Rangeland Stewardship Department, supporting graduate students in their work. During his free time, he actively participates in citizen science projects and pursues passion for outdoor activities such as backpacking, climbing, birding, photography, and more. During the summer of 2022, Mickey began  volunteer work at the Museum, focusing on handling groups of moths and bees. He has contributed to the data basing efforts for both the Montana Moth Project and the iDigBees project through the SCAN Portal. Building on this experience, he extended his involvement by participating in a pollinator BioBlitz with the museum in Glacier National Park. Currently, he is engaged in an independent study, delving into the intricacies of moth diversity and abundance.
